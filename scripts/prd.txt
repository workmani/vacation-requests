# Overview
The Vacation Request Application is a web-based platform that enables employees to submit time off requests which managers can review, approve, or deny. It streamlines the time off management process by providing a centralized system for tracking and managing employee vacation time.

# Core Features
1. **User Authentication (Microsoft Entra)**
   - Secure login for employees and managers
   - Role-based access control (employee vs. manager views)
   - Integration with Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD)

2. **Time Off Request Submission**
   - Form for submitting date ranges, reason, and type of time off
   - Calendar visualization for selecting dates
   - Validation for available time off balance
   - Support for different time off types (vacation, sick, personal, etc.)

3. **Request Management**
   - Dashboard for employees to view their request history and status
   - Manager interface for reviewing pending requests
   - Approval/denial workflow with optional comments
   - Email notifications for status changes

4. **Time Off Balance Tracking**
   - Display of available time off balances by category
   - Automatic balance updates based on approved requests
   - Year-end rollover policies

5. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Calendar view of team availability
   - Reports on time off usage patterns
   - Export functionality for HR purposes

# User Experience
**User Personas:**
- **Regular Employee:** Needs to request time off and track balances
- **Manager:** Reviews and manages team members' requests
- **HR Administrator:** Configures policies and generates reports

**Key User Flows:**
- Employee submits a new time off request
- Manager receives notification and reviews request
- Employee receives approval/denial notification
- HR runs reports on time off usage

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
- Intuitive calendar interface for date selection
- Clear status indicators for request progress
- Accessible design for all users

# Technical Architecture
## System Components
- **Frontend:** Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes
- **Database:** SQL database (PostgreSQL) for user data, requests, and configurations
- **Authentication:** Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) integration
- **Email Service:** Integration with SMTP service for notifications

## Data Models
1. **User**
   - Basic info (name, email, department)
   - Role (employee, manager, admin)
   - Manager relationship
   - Time off balances by category

2. **TimeOffRequest**
   - Start/end dates
   - Type of time off
   - Status (pending, approved, denied)
   - Comments
   - Timestamps for creation and updates

3. **TimeOffBalance**
   - User relationship
   - Balance categories (vacation, sick, personal)
   - Accrual records
   - Used and remaining balances

4. **Department**
   - Name
   - Manager
   - Members

## API Routes
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/requests` - CRUD operations for time off requests
- `/api/users` - User management
- `/api/balances` - Time off balance operations
- `/api/departments` - Department management
- `/api/reports` - Reporting endpoints

## Infrastructure
- Vercel deployment
- PostgreSQL database
- Microsoft Entra for authentication
- Email delivery service

# Development Roadmap
## Phase 1: Foundation & MVP
1. Project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
2. Database schema design and implementation
3. Microsoft Entra authentication integration
4. Basic user management and role definition
5. Simple time off request form and submission process
6. Basic manager approval interface
7. Email notifications for status changes

## Phase 2: Core Functionality Enhancement
1. Time off balance tracking and automatic updates
2. Calendar visualization for request selection
3. Dashboard views for employees and managers
4. Request history and status tracking
5. Comment system for request discussion
6. Enhanced email notifications with templates

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

2. Reporting and analytics functionality
3. Department-level views and reports
4. Request conflicts detection
5. Enhanced mobile experience
6. Export functionality for reports

## Phase 4: Refinement and Optimization
1. Performance optimizations
2. UI/UX improvements based on user feedback
3. Advanced filtering and search capabilities
4. Customizable workflows and approval chains
5. Integration with calendar systems (Outlook, Google)

# Logical Dependency Chain
1. **Foundation First:**
   - Project setup and configuration
   - Authentication system
   - Database schema and basic models
   - User roles and permissions

2. **Core Employee Functionality:**
   - Time off request submission form
   - Basic dashboard for employees
   - Request history view

3. **Manager Review System:**
   - Manager dashboard
   - Request approval/denial interface
   - Simple notification system

4. **Enhanced Experience:**
   - Calendar visualization
   - Time off balance tracking
   - Email notifications

5. **Advanced Features:**
   - Reporting and analytics
   - Team calendar views
   - Export functionality

# Risks and Mitigations
1. **Microsoft Entra Integration Complexity**
   - Risk: Integration with Microsoft Entra could be complex and time-consuming
   - Mitigation: Begin with the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and start integration early in the development process

2. **Data Integrity for Time Off Balances**
   - Risk: Calculations for time off balances must be accurate and consistent
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive unit tests for balance calculations and track all balance changes in an audit log

3. **User Adoption**
   - Risk: Users may resist changing from current process
   - Mitigation: Focus on intuitive UI/UX and provide clear documentation

4. **Performance with Large Organizations**
   - Risk: System may slow down with many users and requests
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, caching, and database optimizations from the start
